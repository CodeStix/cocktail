# Cocktail Machine

This repository contains the source code for the user interface and the backend code for my cocktail mixing machine. The machine supports up to 12 ingredients that are pumped via peristaltic pumps (from a fridge inside the machine) + sparking water + cooled water + tap water. 
These ingredients can be combined to create different recipies using the user interface on the device's touchscreeen.

It is built using a Asus TinkerBoard S2 and TypeScript. The frontend is built using React + TypeScript + Radix UI. The backend uses NodeJS with custom bindings to the Asus GPIO C++ API.
